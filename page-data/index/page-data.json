Often glass slides break and with time entire collections\nare decimated, obliging histology teachers to replace the sections and even the whole collection.\nThese activities are not only expensive but also time consuming. In addition, it is essential to\nhave microscopes in good working conditions and with acceptable optics. Again, good quality\ninstruments are expensive and require regular maintenance. The use of microscope also entails\nthe utilization of oil immersion which frequently results in contamination of objectives,\nparticularly the high dry objective. Finally and more importantly, the use of microscopes\nsometimes slows down the teaching dynamics of the class and is not ideal for small group\nteaching since the demonstrator or the leading student must change sections, or objectives,\nand/or clean objectives and slides after the use of oil immersion. Arguably, histology teachers are\nconstantly in the search of a more effective teaching tool that will permit him/her to avoid the\ncost and effort of maintaining histological collections and microscopes.</p>\n<p>Three years ago while attending the annual meeting of the American Society of Cell Biology\n(ASCB), I visited a couple of firms promoting the use of a new technology for pathologists,\nwhich consisted in creating crisp and clear digitized histological sections or digital slides. In\nother words, entire sections were digitized by precision scanners that created seamless true color\ndigital slide images of the entire section in a matter of minutes. Using a state of the art software\nthat simulated the use of a microscope, the whole section could be examined in a computer in\nsitu or in a remote place via the internet in real time. The section could be moved in all directions\nand magnified up to x1000.</p>\n<p>When I asked the representatives of these firms if these devices were used in the teaching of\nhistology, they responded that they were unaware of their use other than in pathology\nlaboratories. The scanner alone had a cost of $100,000 US making impossible to even consider\nthe possibility of acquiring such an instrument for teaching purposes.</p>\n<p>Two years ago I learned that a U.S. company called Aperio not only offered scanners but also a\nscanning service at an accessible cost. I contacted this firm with my project to digitize the Box of\nSlides of the undergraduate course Introduction to Dynamic Histology (ANAT 261) and the Box\nof Slides of Medical Histology of the Department of Anatomy and Cell Biology of McGill\nUniversity. I selected the best available sections (although there is always room for\nimprovement), and they are now available for the teaching of histology in both curricular\nactivities.</p>\n<p>We started implementing this approach as an experimental tool for the teaching of histology, in\nthe undergraduate course Introduction to Dynamic Histology at the end of the 2006 semester. To\nmy knowledge, this converted McGill into the first Canadian University to use digitized slides\nfor the teaching of histology. This year the system is fully operational for Medical Histology\nwith an impressive box of 100 slides, thus, incorporating our Medical School among the twothirds of the top 15 rated US hospitals and the top academic medical centers worldwide that use\nAperio technology. The advantages of this new approach for the teaching of histology are\nenormous, commencing with the availability of a high quality teaching set of histological \nsections. The digitized sections permit the application of various techniques, including classroom\ndigital teaching, synchronized examination of slides, self-study in situ and from a remote place\nvia the internet in real time. Digital slides can also be used in lectures, reviews and\ndemonstrations. This system is also ideal for the rapid design of lab exams, for mid-term, and\nfinal exams.</p>\n<p>It is my intention to perfection with time the slide boxes of both, Introduction to Dynamic\nHistology and Medical Curriculum by replacing some existing sections by better ones and by\nintroducing new sections as they become available. Along with the digitized sections I am\nproviding the list of sections as they were listed in their original slides boxes. The list can be\nfound find in the folders “Introduction to Dynamic Histology 261 Guide” and “Medical\nHistology Guide”.</p>\n<div>\n <strong>Carlos R.
